# NetflixMoviesEDA
An Exploratory Data Analysis of Netflix movies dataset with Python(Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib). This projects aims at investigating trends in Netlix movie duration to ascertain if movies are getting shorter overtime.

In this project I analyzed a dataset containing information on 7,788 Netflix movies to investigate trends in movie duration. Identified and addressed data quality issues. Visualized the results using Python's Matplotlib library, creating a scatter plot to explore movie duration by release year, effectively communicating the findings that movie duration are not reducing over time.
